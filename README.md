# PassMan
Windows Password Manager Developed in MSVS C#. Encrypts/Decrypts up to 128 chars of text. Read more about this project on my blog, [https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/](https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/30/simple-encryption-in-c/).

PassMan derives quasi-unique encryption keys from user passwords and implements a from-scratch symmetric encryption/decryption algorithm that is based on Fermat's Little Theorem.
