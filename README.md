# PassMan
Windows Password Manager Developed in MSVS C#. Encrypts/Decrypts up to 128 chars of text. Read more about this project on my blog, [https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/](https://dylansamcsblog.wordpress.com/).

PassMan implements a symmetric encryption/decryption algorithm developed from scratch that is based on Fermat's Little Theorem, and derives quasi-unique encryption keys from user passwords.
